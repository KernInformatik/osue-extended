 * @brief Provides functions to set up and tear down shared memory and semaphores for IPC between a server and client
process
 * @details This module wraps shm_open(3), mmap(2), and sem_open(3) into a small
 *          set of create/connect/destroy/disconnect functions. A server process
 *          must call the *_create functions before any client calls *_connect,
 *          since the server is responsible for allocating the underlying
 *          resources. There must be exactly one server; there may be many
 *          clients.
 * @version 0.1
